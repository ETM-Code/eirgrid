# Irish Power Grid Simulation Visualizer

This web-based visualization tool allows you to explore and analyze the results of the Irish power grid simulation. It displays settlements, power generators, and carbon offsets on a map of Ireland, along with metrics and trends over time.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: View settlements, power generators, and carbon offset projects on a map of Ireland
- **Timeline**: Navigate through the years of the simulation using a slider or playback controls
- **Metrics Panel**: See key metrics for each year including population, power usage, generation, and emissions
- **Trend Charts**: View how metrics change over time with interactive charts

## Setup Instructions

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser

### Using with Simulation Data

The visualizer can load CSV data generated by the simulation. By default, it will look for data in the following locations:

- `data/simulation_summary.csv`: Summary metrics for the entire simulation
- `data/yearly_details/settlements.csv`: Detailed data about settlements for each year
- `data/yearly_details/generators.csv`: Detailed data about power generators for each year
- `data/yearly_details/carbon_offsets.csv`: Detailed data about carbon offset projects for each year

If the CSV files are not found, the visualizer will generate sample data for demonstration purposes.

## Controls

- **Play Button**: Start the simulation playback
- **Pause Button**: Pause the simulation playback
- **Reset Button**: Reset the simulation to the start year
- **Timeline Slider**: Manually select a specific year
- **Map Controls**: Zoom and pan the map, and switch between different base map layers

## Visualization Elements

### Map Markers

- **Blue Circles**: Settlements (size indicates population)
- **Green Circles**: Renewable energy generators (size indicates power output)
- **Orange Circles**: Fossil fuel generators (size indicates power output)
- **Purple Circles**: Nuclear generators (size indicates power output)
- **Light Blue Circles**: Energy storage facilities (size indicates capacity)
- **Green Squares**: Carbon offset projects (size indicates offset amount)

### Charts

- **Emissions Chart**: Shows COâ‚‚ emissions, carbon offsets, and net emissions over time
- **Power Chart**: Shows power generation, usage, and balance over time

## Technical Details

The visualization is built using the following libraries:

- **Leaflet**: For the interactive map
- **D3.js**: For data visualization and SVG manipulation
- **Chart.js**: For trend charts
- **PapaParse**: For CSV parsing
- **noUiSlider**: For the timeline slider

The code is organized into modular components:

- `grid-coordinates.js`: Handles conversion between simulation grid coordinates and GPS coordinates
- `data-loader.js`: Loads and processes CSV data
- `map-setup.js`: Initializes the Leaflet map
- `visualization.js`: Handles the visualization of data on the map
- `timeline.js`: Manages the timeline controls
- `charts.js`: Creates and updates the trend charts
- `main.js`: Integrates all components and initializes the application
